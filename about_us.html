    </br>
    <p>
      We has been Roseburg's premier plant nursery for over 40 years. In 1977 the Lander family purchased the nursery. With a well-established reputation for quality and knowledgeable service, the store retained the name of Gardening Workshop. Originally the nurseryÂ was known as Sunning Garden & Pets, but over the years the focus of Gardening Workshop has shifted from pets to a full garden center including pond supplies and yard & home decor.
